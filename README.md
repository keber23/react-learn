# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Node version v20.9.0

In order to install API please run 2 commands in bash:

1. chmod +x setup_api.sh
2. ./setup_api.sh

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Concurrently runs both the API server and React app using `start:api` and `start:page` scripts.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start:api`

Starts the Movies API server.

### `npm run start:page`

Starts the React app.

### `npm run cy:open`

Runs Cypress in interactive mode, opening the Cypress Test Runner.

### `npm run cy:run`

Runs Cypress tests in headless mode.

### `npm run cypress:open`

Starts the development server and then opens Cypress in interactive mode.

### `npm run cypress:run`

Starts the development server and runs Cypress tests in headless mode.

### `npm run storybook`

Starts Storybook for developing UI components.

### `npm run build-storybook`

Builds Storybook as a static web application.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
